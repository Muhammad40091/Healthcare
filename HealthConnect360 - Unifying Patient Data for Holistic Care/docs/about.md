# Project background

The `pxtextmining` package is part of [the Patient Experience Qualitative Data Categorisation project](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/PatientExperience-QDC/). This project is is hosted by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's Clinical Development Unit Data Science Team, and funded by NHS England's Insight and Feedback Team.

The primary objective of the `pxtextmining` element is to create a machine learning model capable of categorising the free text data obtained through the [NHS England Friends and Family Test](https://www.england.nhs.uk/fft/) (FFT). It is a multilabel classification problem, with one or more categories applied to each patient feedback comment. In this way, we hope to support better use of qualitative patient experience feedback by NHS provider organisations.

This package works together with the [experiencesdashboard](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/experiencesdashboard), a frontend coded in R/Shiny.
