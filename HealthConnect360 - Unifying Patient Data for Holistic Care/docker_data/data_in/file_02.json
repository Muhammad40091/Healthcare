When I called Parkway Medical they had no record of this, and that NHS111 should have booked for me, so couldn\u2019t give me a GP check and to go to a walk-in centre. As I had previously been admitted on an antibiotic drip for two days from RVI ambulatory care with the same symptoms, and had been told to be seen the same day by the GP, I was surprised the NHS111 had not notified the surgery. I called NHS111 to check if they had contacted the GP and that if I went to a walkin centre that they would have the necessary info from my call, and was told they would contact me. A person called back who informed me that this was just an emergency service, of which I am very aware, and had not requested a call back, just wanting to know if the info would be sent, as so far it had not been. The GP practice subsequently mentioned that they do not always receive notifications of calls, even for the same day so this had meant I had waited until the GP practice opened before being told to travel some distance to the walkin centre. I understood the service was to be used if the GP practice was not open and I had been following NHS directions to ring if GP practice not open and I was puzzled as to why NHS111 had not informed the GP to enable a same day examination as suggested. I went to a walkin centre and was sent to hospital again, subsequently seeing a consultant. There seems to be a lack of communication between NHS111 and GP practice, and the GP practice has a tendency to overuse NHS111 telling me to ring 111 when I merely ring for a GP appointment.

I spoke for an hour, and during the session I was made to feel like I didn't have post natal depression. I was told by this doctor that all the events in my life was just making me feel sad. I was and I am still, having suicidal thoughts every single day and my mood has changed drastically since giving birth. I have never felt so low in my entire life, but for some reason this was downplayed by the junior doctor, and I felt belittled. At the end of the session she asked me if I was willing to take medication, and I said no. She then told me that she can't help me because all they do there is medicate people, and that they don't do therapy. I don't understand why she made me pour my heart out for an hour, and talk about my life, if at the end of the day she just wanted me to take her drugs. I was deeply upset and disappointed with this service. It was a massive waste of my time and energy and I went home in tears feeling 100 times worse than when I got there. Please can you educate your junior doctors on what post natal depression is, and how hormonal imbalance can really affect your mood, in which some women can have depression, some can even have psychosis and commit suicide.

I understand the pandemic has disrupted services but this shouldn't alter the amount of group therapy given. Using the pandemic as an excuse to cut out months at the end of my group therapy because you thought I needed support then rather than later, is unacceptable. I wasn't given the option to make the decision for myself in my care. I had no choice I had to take the phone calls. If I had the choice I would've waited for group therapy to start rather than having to take one to one phone calls, as part of my group therapy time scale. If I was told that those phone calls would be taken off the end of my group therapy, and if I was given the choice I would've waited for group to start. Those phone calls really should've been classed as support calls rather than group MBT. I have waited years for this personalised therapy, I only get one chance in my lifetime to access it. Yet you have cut my time short by months. I now have to sit in group therapy listening to my therapist say to the new starters that they will have a \"full year of group therapy to explore their difficulties.\" Hearing those words was like a dagger to my heart. You chose to end my therapy on fri 13th, the most unlucky day of the year. Also 3 days before my birthday. I also found out that I'm the first person to leave the group even though we all started together. Do you know how that all feels? Obviously no, thought has gone in to thinking about the individual, me. How all this would make me feel. I was also told I was going to get an Autism assessment. I've not heard anything so I guess this is no longer going ahead. I was told this assessment would help see if I have Autism or other mental health disorders, as it is looking like I have more than BPD. Now I feel all this research has stopped because of how soon you are making me leave, as there is not enough time now. I had high hopes for getting the treatment time needed but you didn't give it me. You can't alter treatment because of a pandemic especially when this treatment is a one off access.

On [Date Redacted] I had an initial assessment with a junior doctor, which I had waited 2 months for. She asked me questions about my life and I told her a lot, believing that it was therapy. I spoke for an hour, and during the session I was made to feel like I didn't have post natal depression. I was told by this doctor that all the events in my life was just making me feel sad. I was and I am still, having suicidal thoughts every single day and my mood has changed drastically since giving birth. I have never felt so low in my entire life, but for some reason this was downplayed by the junior doctor, and I felt belittled. At the end of the session she asked me if I was willing to take medication, and I said no. She then told me that she can't help me because all they do there is medicate people, and that they don't do therapy. I don't understand why she made me pour my heart out for an hour, and talk about my life, if at the end of the day she just wanted me to take her drugs. I was deeply upset and disappointed with this service. It was a massive waste of my time and energy and I went home in tears feeling 100 times worse than when I got there. Please can you educate your junior doctors on what post natal depression is, and how hormonal imbalance can really affect your mood, in which some women can have depression, some can even have psychosis and commit suicide. It is serious and not something that should be downplayed. I was told that I would be referred back to pts, but I still have not heard anything from anyone.

I had to insist to final paramedic call handler that his condition may have been terminal but at that moment in time there had been no indication either to myself or professional medical team involved in his care to make us believe he was dying that day.  Even if he had been he was in severe pain they could hear him and felt they treat him worse than an animal leaving it so long before they agreed to send an ambulance.  I believe I made the first call between 7-8 and the ambulance wasn\u2019t despatched u til after midnight.  If i had been able to move him I would have put him in car and taken there by myself.  I actually received this text today whilst sitting with the registrar registering his death.

I am on Redwood 1 in Highbury Hospital. I have only just realized that when that under section 2 I am a voluntary patient. Now the application has been made for me to be on section 3, I am aware. When individuals in the ward 'dominate' each other in arguments it feels as if I am helpless to socialize and aid the situation; for myself. Staff do not care nor get involved, even when requested kindly. My knowledge of sections 2 and 3 is more importantly not very good, therefore should I wish to get leave to go home, or return home, it is rarely granted. I have left hospital grounds once before, yet even to get a breath of fresh air seems hard to come by. The staff and patients here are keeping me as if I am a caged animal. However just before the application has been made for section 3, I realise only then that I was on section 2, more specifically as a voluntary patient. During my stay here I did not realize I was a voluntary patient on section 2. Now the application has been made for me to be here under section 3 as a formal patient. I feel the actions of the patients and staff here are discussing and doing things that are beyond my comprehension. They have been doing this since I have entered the hospital, far too frequently for it to be considered a friendly or helpful response. I have been trapped here as a voluntary patient! It seems like when I play chess on my phone or the internet, there is little I can do, or by comparison when socializing or when I express myself. In conclusion, I was unable to leave the hospital under the Mental Health Act. The staff could manage the patients better. Individuals such as '[Nickname redacted]' seem to be dominating other males on the ward, asking them many questions about religion, politics and this is not appropriate. His actions are not being appropriately managed, and I feel and realize he is one of the many individuals stopping me from socializing with other human beings. This lack of human contact is not being managed properly. The nurse \"[Name redacted]\" seems to accompany me to every important appointment I have. She is elderly and African, and looks related to the man [Name redacted]! This is a silly comparison of course. The staff here when requested are not showing me there last names on their lanyards, when I want to make a formal or informal complaint, verbally, it goes unheard. They are professionals here. Individuals are taking videos on social media, and they aren't handling this correctly either. I have had visitors whilst I am here, yet it seems many patients here are coming and going as they please. I rarely get to leave here under section 2. I have trusted them with a lot of sensitive information which I think is quite important to consider in the way I am being 'handled' here. Expressing myself verbally seems extraordinarily difficult, as what I say, in comparison to what I type and write, can be easily misinterpreted. I would like to return home to my immediate family, and those I love and value.
